      Croissants are a popular type of pastry that originates from France, known
      for their buttery, flaky texture, and unique crescent shape. They are
      traditionally made from a yeast-leavened dough that is layered with butter
      through a meticulous process called lamination. This process involves
      folding and rolling the dough multiple times, creating alternating layers
      of dough and butter. Croissants are commonly enjoyed for breakfast or as a
      snack, often served with coffee or tea.
